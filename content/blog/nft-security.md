There are many "gotcha's" associated with NFT's.  This post looks at the NFT landscape.  It is intended to help educate the NFT minter, the  potential initial buyer, and potential buyers later. Before you decide to swim with the sharks consider the following questions:

How do I know if my NFT is legitimate
Can someone replicate my NFT?
NFT disputed ownership?
Can a seller mint multiple copies of the same NFT?
Can someone else mint the NFT either I've minted myself, or now currently own?
My NFT shows up in my wallet, that means I own it, right?
My NFT is stored on IPFS, isn't that what I want?
Can my NFT disappear?
what if the marketplace wehre I puirchased my NFT goes out of business?


What is an NFT?
NFT stands for Nonfungible Token.  in short, it is a digital file which has been minted on a blockchain.  Meaning this file representing "something" has been created on a blockchain.
