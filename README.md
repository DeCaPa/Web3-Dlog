## About
This repo is the source code for my distributed/decentralized, web3 blog.  Or "dlog" if you will. It is a blog written using Hugo as the static site generator.  Props goes to [pacollins](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim) for providing an awesome theme template.

The generated site runs and is distributed on the Internet Planetary File System (IPFS).
